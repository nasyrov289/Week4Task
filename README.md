# Week4Task
## About Task
The Week 4 Task was:
```
Design 4-5 API endpoints that perform various actions with records in your local database.

Examples:
- Add a new record
- Update some attribute value of a record
- Change records that have some timestamp range (if you use timestamps)

Implement 2 of your APIs completely. Test the endpoints, write down how you tested them in a .txt file.

Push the code and the test notes into your remote repository.
