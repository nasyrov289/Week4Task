***** Test GET request *****

GET request gets the resources

1) Run SpringCloudMysqlApplication.java for run Spring main method

2) Launched a browser and wrote the address of the local host http://localhost:8080/
(I saw an error because the address was not quite correct. It was empty)

3) Launched Postman and entered http://localhost:8080/admin in the request field. Sent a GET request and received an empty field with [].

4) Testing of GET request is done
